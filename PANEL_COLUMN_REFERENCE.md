## Contextual outcome variables (row-level)

These columns capture aggregate/reported outcomes from DWP and Task Force sources. They apply to specific quarters only (NaN elsewhere).

| Column | Description | Real or estimated | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| off_all_benefits_% | % of SSI+supply-chain claimants who ended benefit claim | REAL (Q3/Q4 2016 only) | DWP September 2016 report |

| self_employment_n | Count of new businesses started | REAL | SSI Task Force One Year On Report |
| training_courses_n | Number of training courses approved for SSI workers | REAL | SSI Task Force reports (15,510 total) |
| area_wage_change_% | Change in RC LA / Teesside area wages (pre vs post) | ESTIMATED_LOW | Hardcoded in build_redcar_panel.py (-0.5% real terms, 2015-2017). Only populated for one scenario row per quarter. Source: ONS place-based earnings estimates, not fetched live. |
| ne_wage_change_% | Change in NE median wage (year on year) | ESTIMATED_LOW | Hardcoded in build_redcar_panel.py (+1.6%). Only populated for one scenario row per quarter. |
| manual_jobs_share_pre_% | Manual/blue-collar jobs as % of RC LA employment pre-closure | ESTIMATED_LOW | Hardcoded in build_redcar_panel.py (10.0%, Dec 2014). Only populated for one scenario row. BRES-derived estimate. |
| manual_jobs_share_post_% | Same share post-closure | ESTIMATED_LOW | Hardcoded in build_redcar_panel.py (8.0%, Dec 2016). Only populated for one scenario row. |

**Sparseness note:** `area_wage_change_%`, `ne_wage_change_%`, `manual_jobs_share_pre_%`, and `manual_jobs_share_post_%` are populated for only 15 rows (one scenario per quarter at 2017Q4). These are hardcoded point estimates in `build_redcar_panel.py`, not live-fetched series. Treat as indicative context, not time-varying data.

## ACC by age and gender (Stat-Xplore, RC LA) — acc_* columns

Real DWP administrative data. Parsed from Stat-Xplore ACC4 (Age by Gender, Redcar and Cleveland LA). Monthly counts aggregated to quarterly means. Baseline = mean of 2019 months. Excess = actual minus baseline, clamped at zero.

Data quality: HIGH for all acc_* columns.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| acc_16_24_male_q_mean | Mean monthly male ACC claimants aged 16-24 in RC LA |
| acc_16_24_female_q_mean | Mean monthly female ACC claimants aged 16-24 in RC LA |
| acc_25_49_male_q_mean | Mean monthly male ACC claimants aged 25-49 in RC LA |
| acc_25_49_female_q_mean | Mean monthly female ACC claimants aged 25-49 in RC LA |
| acc_50plus_male_q_mean | Mean monthly male ACC claimants aged 50+ in RC LA |
| acc_50plus_female_q_mean | Mean monthly female ACC claimants aged 50+ in RC LA |
| acc_total_q_mean | Total ACC claimants (all ages, both genders) in RC LA |
| acc_16_24_pct | 16-24 share of total RC LA ACC claimants (%) |
| acc_25_49_pct | 25-49 share |
| acc_50plus_pct | 50+ share |
| acc_male_pct | Male share of total RC LA ACC claimants (%) |
| acc_female_pct | Female share |
| acc_excess_16_24_pct | 16-24 share of EXCESS claimants (SSI shock proxy — proportion of shock-attributable claimants who are 16-24) |
| acc_excess_25_49_pct | 25-49 share of excess claimants |
| acc_excess_50plus_pct | 50+ share of excess claimants |
| acc_excess_male_pct | Male share of excess claimants |
| acc_data_quality | Always HIGH |

**Key finding:** RC LA 50+ share ~27% (prior assumption was 50%); male share ~62% (prior from steel-sector norms was 95%). The excess shares are a better proxy for SSI worker demographics than the total shares.

**UC caveat:** From mid-2016 onward, UC migration means some claimants who would previously appear in ACC/JSA do not appear. ACC counts from 2017 onward undercount true labour market activity relative to the pre-UC baseline.

---

## NE ACC by age band — ne_acc_* columns

North East regional ACC by model age band, from Nomis NM_162_1. Used as a regional benchmark to assess whether RC LA's age composition was typical of the broader NE claimant population.

Data quality: HIGH.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| ne_acc_16_24_q_mean | Mean monthly NE ACC claimants aged 16-24 |
| ne_acc_25_49_q_mean | Mean monthly NE ACC claimants aged 25-49 |
| ne_acc_50plus_q_mean | Mean monthly NE ACC claimants aged 50+ |
| ne_acc_total_q_mean | Total NE ACC claimants (all ages) |
| ne_acc_16_24_pct | 16-24 share of NE total ACC (%) |
| ne_acc_25_49_pct | 25-49 share |
| ne_acc_50plus_pct | 50+ share |
| ne_acc_data | Always HIGH |

---

## RC vs NE comparison indices — rc_vs_ne_* columns

Ratio of RC LA age share to NE age share for each model band. Index > 1 means RC LA is more heavily weighted toward that band than the North East average. Derived from acc_*_pct and ne_acc_*_pct.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| rc_vs_ne_16_24_idx | RC LA 16-24 ACC share / NE 16-24 ACC share |
| rc_vs_ne_25_49_idx | RC LA 25-49 share / NE 25-49 share |
| rc_vs_ne_50plus_idx | RC LA 50+ share / NE 50+ share |

## NE JSA by duration — ne_jsa_* columns

North East JSA claimant stock broken into duration bands, from Nomis NM_4_1 (Jobseeker's Allowance by Age and Duration). Monthly data aggregated to quarterly means. Sex=total (male+female combined). All age groups combined.

Data quality: HIGH. Fetched by `fetch_redcar_extra.py`. Cache stored in `_nomis_cache/ne_jsa_duration_raw.csv`.

**Important UC caveat:** From mid-2016 Universal Credit progressively absorbed short-term JSA claimants. The rising long-term % from 2016 onward reflects this composition shift — short-term claimants move to UC and disappear from JSA stock — not necessarily a worsening of outcomes. The absolute count of 52+ week claimants stays roughly flat at ~11-12k throughout the period.

**Geography note:** NM_4_1 JSA duration is suppressed at local authority level by DWP. North East regional level (E12000001) is available and used here as a benchmark.

| Column | Description | Real or estimated | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| ne_jsa_under13wk_q_mean | Mean monthly NE JSA claimants with duration <13 weeks | HIGH | Nomis NM_4_1 |
| ne_jsa_13to26wk_q_mean | Mean monthly NE JSA claimants with duration 13-26 weeks | HIGH | Nomis NM_4_1 |
| ne_jsa_26to52wk_q_mean | Mean monthly NE JSA claimants with duration 26-52 weeks | HIGH | Nomis NM_4_1 |
| ne_jsa_over52wk_q_mean | Mean monthly NE JSA claimants with duration 52+ weeks (long-term unemployed) | HIGH | Nomis NM_4_1 |
| ne_jsa_total_q_mean | Total NE JSA claimants (all duration bands) | HIGH | Nomis NM_4_1 |
| ne_jsa_longterm_pct | 52+ week claimants as % of NE JSA total | HIGH | Derived |
| ne_jsa_data_quality | Always HIGH | — | — |
| ne_jsa_uc_caveat | Explanatory note on UC composition effect | — | — |

**Key pattern:** Long-term % rises from 27% (2015Q4) to 79% (2019Q4) as UC absorbs short-term claimants. Absolute long-term count stays flat at ~11-12k. SSI workers were predominantly short-to-medium term claimants (survival model: 75% resolved within 4 months).

## ASHE age-specific wage estimates — ashe_age_* columns

ONS does not publish regional ASHE by age band. These are estimated by taking national ASHE Table 6 (age group, weekly gross pay) band ratios (band median / all-workers median) and scaling them against the NE aggregate median (ne_median_weekly_pay_gbp).

Method: NE_band_est = NE_aggregate_median x (national_band_median / national_all_median)

Data quality: HIGH_SCALED — based on HIGH-quality national ASHE data but involves a scaling approximation. The national age ratio is applied uniformly; actual NE age-wage structure may differ.

Annual data (from ONS ASHE Table 6 annual releases). Same value repeated for all quarters in a year.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| ashe_age_data | Always HIGH_SCALED |
| ashe_age_16_24_median_est | Estimated NE median weekly pay for 16-24 age band (GBP) |
| ashe_age_16_24_p10_est | Estimated NE p10 weekly pay for 16-24 |
| ashe_age_16_24_p25_est | Estimated NE p25 weekly pay for 16-24 |
| ashe_age_16_24_p75_est | Estimated NE p75 weekly pay for 16-24 |
| ashe_age_16_24_p90_est | Estimated NE p90 weekly pay for 16-24 |
| ashe_age_16_24_sigma | Log-normal sigma for 16-24 wage distribution (derived from p25/p75) |
| ashe_age_nat_ratio_16_24 | National ratio: 16-24 median / all-workers median (used in scaling) |
| ashe_age_25_49_median_est | Estimated NE median weekly pay for 25-49 |
| ashe_age_25_49_p10_est | Estimated NE p10 for 25-49 |
| ashe_age_25_49_p25_est | Estimated NE p25 for 25-49 |
| ashe_age_25_49_p75_est | Estimated NE p75 for 25-49 |
| ashe_age_25_49_p90_est | Estimated NE p90 for 25-49 |
| ashe_age_25_49_sigma | Log-normal sigma for 25-49 |
| ashe_age_nat_ratio_25_49 | National ratio: 25-49 median / all-workers median |
| ashe_age_50plus_median_est | Estimated NE median weekly pay for 50+ |
| ashe_age_50plus_p10_est | Estimated NE p10 for 50+ |
| ashe_age_50plus_p25_est | Estimated NE p25 for 50+ |
| ashe_age_50plus_p75_est | Estimated NE p75 for 50+ |
| ashe_age_50plus_p90_est | Estimated NE p90 for 50+ |
| ashe_age_50plus_sigma | Log-normal sigma for 50+ |
| ashe_age_nat_ratio_50plus | National ratio: 50+ median / all-workers median |

**Typical values (2016):** 16-24: ~£411/wk, 25-49: ~£545/wk, 50+: ~£521/wk.
**National ratios (stable 2016-2019):** 16-24 ~0.84, 25-49 ~1.11, 50+ ~1.05.

## ESA caseload — esa_* columns

DWP Employment Support Allowance caseload for Redcar and Cleveland LA. Parsed from two Stat-Xplore downloads stored in `_source_data/` (ESA data is split at the Feb 2018 UC transition boundary). Quarterly point-in-time stock figures — each value represents claimants at that quarter, not a monthly mean. Baseline = mean of 2019 quarters. Excess = actual minus baseline, clamped at zero.

Data quality: HIGH (DWP administrative data). Fetched by `integrate_esa.py`.

**Phase definitions:**
- Assessment phase: new or continuing claims being assessed for eligibility
- WRAG (Work-Related Activity Group): assessed as having limited capability for work but expected to prepare for work
- Support group: most severely ill; not expected to seek work

| Column | Description | Real or estimated | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| esa_total_q_mean | Total ESA claimants in RC LA (all phases) | HIGH | DWP Stat-Xplore ESA Caseload |
| esa_assess_q_mean | Assessment phase claimants | HIGH | DWP Stat-Xplore ESA Caseload |
| esa_wrag_q_mean | Work-Related Activity Group claimants | HIGH | DWP Stat-Xplore ESA Caseload |
| esa_support_q_mean | Support group claimants (most severely ill) | HIGH | DWP Stat-Xplore ESA Caseload |
| esa_baseline | Mean ESA total over 2019 quarters (post-shock stable level) | HIGH | Derived |
| esa_excess_q_mean | Excess claimants over 2019 baseline (shock-attributable, clamped >= 0) | HIGH | Derived |
| esa_excess_pct | Excess as % of total SSI workforce (3,500 approximation) | HIGH | Derived |
| esa_data_quality | Always HIGH | — | — |

**Key finding:** ESA total peaked at 7,042 at 2016Q1 (+650 excess claimants = 18.6% of 3,500 SSI workers). Excess persists into 2018, indicating some workers permanently transitioned to health-related benefits. Support group dominates throughout (~4,000/quarter), reflecting the underlying pre-existing health burden in the population rather than acute closure impact.

**Data note:** Phase breakdown at RC LA level is available (not suppressed) for total ESA. This was confirmed by testing during data collection — earlier attempts using Phase of Claim as a table dimension caused suppression; using it as a column dimension with geography as a filter resolved this.

## RC LA population estimates — rc_la_pop_* columns

ONS mid-year population estimates for Redcar and Cleveland LA, fetched from Nomis NM_31_1. Published annually (reference date: mid-June each year). The same annual value is repeated across all three months of each quarter. All 2015-2019 years are available.

Data quality: HIGH (ONS administrative).  Fetched by `fetch_supplementary.py`. Cache stored in `_nomis_cache/rc_population_raw.csv`.

| Column | Description | Real or estimated | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| rc_la_pop_total | Total population, RC LA (ONS mid-year estimate) | HIGH | Nomis NM_31_1 |
| rc_la_pop_year | Calendar year of the mid-year estimate (e.g. 2016) | — | — |
| rc_la_pop_data_quality | Always HIGH | — | — |
| rc_la_pop_working_age | Working-age (16-64) population, RC LA | UNAVAILABLE | NM_31_1 does not return a working-age aggregate via API; single-year-of-age table requires manual summing. All NaN. |

**Values:** 2015=135,370; 2016=135,344; 2017=135,584; 2018=136,276; 2019=136,699. Population is stable, confirming no significant net migration effect during the closure period.

## RC LA house price index — rc_hpi_* columns

Land Registry UK HPI for Redcar and Cleveland LA. Downloaded from the Land Registry linked data browser as a pre-filtered monthly CSV covering October 2015 to December 2019. Monthly figures aggregated to quarterly means and sums. Parsed by `integrate_hpi.py`. Source data stored in `_source_data/ukhpi_rc_2015_2019.csv`.

Data quality: HIGH (Land Registry administrative transactions data).

The HPI index uses January 2015 = 100 as the base across England. RC LA index values in the 73-78 range reflect that RC LA prices are substantially below the England average — not a decline from 100, but rather where RC sits within the national distribution.

| Column | Description | Real or estimated | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| rc_hpi_avg_price_q_mean | Mean of monthly average sale prices (all property types), RC LA (GBP) | HIGH | Land Registry UK HPI |
| rc_hpi_index_q_mean | Mean HPI index (base Jan 2015=100, all property types) | HIGH | Land Registry UK HPI |
| rc_hpi_pct_yoy_q_mean | Mean year-on-year % price change across the quarter | HIGH | Land Registry UK HPI |
| rc_hpi_sales_vol_q_sum | Sum of monthly sales volumes within the quarter (transaction count) | HIGH | Land Registry UK HPI |
| rc_hpi_sales_q_mean | Placeholder column — all NaN. Superseded by rc_hpi_sales_vol_q_sum. | UNAVAILABLE | — |
| rc_hpi_data_quality | Always HIGH | — | — |

**Key pattern:** Prices were falling in 2015Q4 (-1.3% YoY) during the closure shock, recovered slightly through 2016-2017, then softened again in 2018-2019 (-3.2% YoY in 2019Q1). Quarterly average prices range from ~£106k (2015Q4) to ~£113k (2017Q4-2019Q4).

## RC LA housing benefit — rc_hb_* columns (placeholder)

Housing Benefit claimant data is not available via Nomis or any programmatic API. DWP publishes it through Stat-Xplore only (login required). These columns are placeholder stubs — all values are NaN.

To populate: download from Stat-Xplore → Housing Benefit → HB Caseload (tenure type) → Geography: Redcar and Cleveland → Rows: Quarter → 2015Q4 to 2019Q4. Save as `_source_data/hb_redcar_2015_2019.xlsx`.

**Note:** HB claimant counts fall from 2017 onward because Universal Credit absorbed Housing Benefit for working-age claimants. The decline does not fully reflect reduced housing need.

## Statistical estimates — stat_* columns

All stat_* columns are model outputs, not observed data. They are applied uniformly across all row types in a quarter (the same values repeat across the 15 rows of a given quarter). Confidence intervals are 5th/95th percentile from bootstrap or Monte Carlo sampling.

See `stat_method` for the full method chain.

### Method 1: Exponential survival (still-seeking)

Calibrated to two DWP anchors: 25% still-seeking at 2016Q1, ~3% at 2016Q4. Analytically solved lambda = 0.265/month. Bootstrap n=10,000.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| stat_still_seeking_mid_% | % of original workforce still actively job-seeking (mid estimate) |
| stat_still_seeking_lo_% | 5th percentile CI |
| stat_still_seeking_hi_% | 95th percentile CI |

### Method 2: Aggregate log-normal underemployment

P(new wage < 90% of SSI pre-wage) using NE aggregate wage distribution (ne_median_weekly_pay_gbp, ne_wage_p10-p90). Wide CI reflects genuine NE wage dispersion.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| stat_underemployed_mid_% | % of resolved workers earning below 90% of pre-displacement wage (mid) |
| stat_underemployed_lo_% | 5th percentile CI |
| stat_underemployed_hi_% | 95th percentile CI |

### Method 2b: Age-specific log-normal underemployment

Same approach as Method 2 but uses ashe_age_*_median_est and ashe_age_*_sigma for each age band. Applies AGE_WAGE_RATIOS (16-24: 0.840, 25-49: 1.109, 50+: 1.049) to shift the pre-displacement wage benchmark.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| stat_underemployed_16_24_mid_% | Age-specific underemployment estimate for 16-24 (mid) |
| stat_underemployed_16_24_lo_% | 5th percentile CI |
| stat_underemployed_16_24_hi_% | 95th percentile CI |
| stat_underemployed_25_49_mid_% | 25-49 (mid) |
| stat_underemployed_25_49_lo_% | 5th percentile |
| stat_underemployed_25_49_hi_% | 95th percentile |
| stat_underemployed_50plus_mid_% | 50+ (mid) |
| stat_underemployed_50plus_lo_% | 5th percentile |
| stat_underemployed_50plus_hi_% | 95th percentile |

### Method 3: Bayesian Dirichlet-Multinomial outcome split

Cross-episode prior: retrain 25%, share_similar 40%, exit 35% (concentration kappa=20, alpha=[5,8,7]).
RC LA evidence: ACC-derived outcome proportions from panel outcome columns, weighted at 0.3.
Posterior updated over 17 quarters. 10,000 Dirichlet samples for CIs.

These are absolute shares of the original workforce (not of the resolved pool only).

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| stat_retrain_mid_% | % of original workforce who retrained (mid) |
| stat_retrain_lo_% | 5th percentile CI |
| stat_retrain_hi_% | 95th percentile CI |
| stat_share_similar_mid_% | % who found similar-sector work (mid) |
| stat_share_similar_lo_% | 5th percentile |
| stat_share_similar_hi_% | 95th percentile |
| stat_exit_mid_% | % who exited the labour market (mid) |
| stat_exit_lo_% | 5th percentile |
| stat_exit_hi_% | 95th percentile |
| stat_dirichlet_kappa | Prior concentration (kappa=20, effective prior sample size) |
| stat_dirichlet_pi_retrain | Posterior mean proportion for retrain (~0.121) |
| stat_dirichlet_pi_similar | Posterior mean proportion for share_similar (~0.326) |
| stat_dirichlet_pi_exit | Posterior mean proportion for exit (~0.553) |
| stat_method | Full method chain string |

**Posterior mean split:** retrain 12.1%, share_similar 32.6%, exit 55.3%.
The prior said 25/40/35. RC LA ACC data pulled exit up substantially, reflecting an older workforce in a depressed local labour market with few comparable job openings.

## Known gaps

- **Housing Benefit:** rc_hb_* columns are all NaN. DWP only publishes HB data through Stat-Xplore (login required). Manual download needed — see rc_hb_* section above.
- **PIP (Personal Independence Payment):** Not yet in panel. Available from Stat-Xplore → PIP Cases with Entitlement, RC LA, 2015Q4-2019Q4.
- **Working-age population:** rc_la_pop_working_age is NaN. Nomis NM_31_1 does not return a 16-64 aggregate via the API; requires summing single-year-of-age rows manually.
- **JSA duration:** Suppressed at LA level on Nomis. NE regional level (ne_jsa_* columns) is available as a benchmark.
- **Vacancy data:** Nomis regional vacancy series (NM_5_1, NM_19_1-24_1, NM_89_1) all end before 2012. Not available for 2015-2019.
- **UC migration adjustment:** ACC counts from 2017 onward are affected by Universal Credit rollout. No formal adjustment applied; rows from 2017Q1 onward carry a caveat in the notes column.
- **ASHE age x region:** ONS does not publish ASHE by age band at regional level. The ashe_age_* columns use national age ratios scaled to NE aggregate — an approximation.
